# Smart Education for Rural Areas - MERN Stack Web Application

## Project Overview

This project proposes the development of a web-based smart system designed to enhance the quality of education in rural areas. It leverages the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and integrates modern technologies to bridge the educational gap between urban and rural regions.

The system aims to empower rural communities by providing access to education, awareness programs, healthcare collaborations, and digital tools — all in a single, user-friendly web application.

## Objectives

- Provide digital education and resources to rural students
- Raise awareness about smart farming techniques and government schemes
- Enable access to healthcare guidance through doctor collaboration
- Support local agriculture with seed information and weather-based tips
- Encourage higher education through scholarships and incentives
- Improve communication between students and teachers via digital tools
